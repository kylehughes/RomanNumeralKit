/**
 A tally mark used for counting.

 This is the atomic component that backs the value of each Roman numeral symbol. Tally marks are typically counted in
 groups (see `RomanNumeralTallyMarkGroup`).

 The tally mark should not be confused with the Roman numeral symbol `I`, although both share the same numeric value.
 The tally mark is represented using the ASCII "vertical bar" character.
